Hereâ€™s a detailed `README.md` for your **Mindful Path** journaling app:

# Mindful Path

Mindful Path is a Stoic-inspired journaling web application designed to help users reflect on their daily actions. Inspired by a simple yet powerful journaling framework, the app provides an easy way to review your day and foster self-improvement.

---

## Features

- **Daily Journaling**: Answer three core Stoic questions:
  1. What did you do well today?
  2. What did you do poorly?
  3. What should you do to become a better version of yourself?
- **Quote of the Day**: Get inspired with random Stoic quotes displayed on the journaling page.
- **Journal Archives**: View past journal entries sorted by date.
- **Markdown Export**: Export all journal entries as markdown files in a ZIP archive.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
